Today, the Udyogamandal Plants has an installed capacity of 76,050 tonnes of N and 29700 tonnes of P2O5.  Apart from fertilisers like Ammonium Sulphate and Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (FACTAMFOS 20:20:0:13) FACT Udyogamandal Plants also manufactures chemicals as intermediate products like Sulphuric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia, Phosphoric Acid, Sulphur Dioxide, Oleum, etc. Ammonium Sulphate liquor obtained as a by product from the Caprolactam Plant is converted as a useful fertiliser product in a New Ammonium Sulphate Plant, 2,25,000 TPA capacity put up in October 1990, at a cost of Rs.35 crore. As a replacement to the existing high energy consuming old Ammonia plants at Udyogamandal, a new 900 TPD capacity Ammonia Plant at a cost of Rs.642 crore was put up in March 1998.  FACT Udyogamandal plants received ISO 14001 certification in March 2000 for conforming to the Environmental Management System standard.",
